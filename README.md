# AA-IB-ME

This is the official implementation of the AA-IB-ME cryptography scheme in the Java programming language based on the JPBC library, which outperforms the baselines, the [Fuzzy-IB-ME](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Fuzzy_IB_ME) and [Fuzzy-ME](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Fuzzy_ME) cryptography schemes. 

This repository is a part of the [cryptography schemes](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Cryptography-Schemes). 

As this version utilized outdated application programming interfaces (APIs), the repository will **no longer be maintained**.
